# Data Wrangling Practice
## by Sean Zhong


## Dataset

This data wrangling/analysis was done as a project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. I practiced data wrangling techniques on the a WeRateDogs tweet archive starting from their first tweet to 8/1/2017. The data came in three sets: a twitter archive csv file on hand (given by Udacity), a tweet image predictions file programmatically downloaded from Udacity servers, and corresponding tweet json data downloaded from Twitter via their API. In addition to data wrangling, I also did some light analysis and visualization.

A more in-depth write-up of my data wrangling and analysis steps can be found in **wrangle_report.pdf**.
